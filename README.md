## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an aspiring software engineer currently completing a Bachelor of Computer Science The University of British Columbia Vancouver. I've got an extensive background in healthcare, having worked as a respiratory therapist in a wide variety of care settings and having completed a Bachelor of Health Administration at Toronto Metropolitan University. I enjoy delivering effective solutions to tough, time-sensitive challenges using critical reasoning and collaboration.

I'm passionate about building rigorous and impactful software that's easy to reason about, reuse, and extend, and that make a meaningful difference for people, no matter how small. I'm always on the lookout for opportunities to learn or contributeâ€”you can reach me through my LinkedIn profile! Thanks for reading.
